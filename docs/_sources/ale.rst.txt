Usage
-----

Requisites
----------

The explainer requires the training data, the predict function attached to the model and a feature to globally explain.

Accepted Models/Data
--------------------

Data
^^^^

Currently supported datatypes are:

* Tabular data

Within this type, categorical features are not yet supported and so the only type supported thusfar is regular numerical data.

Models
^^^^^^

As the explainer only requires the predict function to be passed as a parameter, in theory any model can be used.

Dimensionality

Caveats
-------

The most important caveat with ALE is that it's easy to get into a false sense of security in regard to interpreting the plots. Despite it taking correlation between features into consideration, 
interpreting an ALE of one of two strongly correlated features doesn't give the full picture. This is a problem when analysing correlated features rather than a problem with ALE.

Theoretically you can plot 2 features against each other like with PDP, however because the ALE package is very undeveloped, this is not yet available.

ALE segments the range of feature values into bins, the number of which can be specified. A large number of bins gives greater accuracy but comes at the cost of a jagged graph. This can 
make the general trend harder to grasp. Alternatively too few bins will give a graph that's not very faithful to the actual model response.



Output interpretation
---------------------

ALE plots have the full range of feature values on the x axis, with the y axis representing the difference in the model response with respect to the mean.

In the example below you can see that the number of bikes rented were at their lowest on Sunday, and gets progressively higher as the week goes on. This makes a lot of sense
as renting a bike is typically a tourist activity, something which is likely to occur on weekends.

If you compare this to its counterpart, PDP, you can see that the differences between values is a lot more pronounced. This is because PDP cannot seperate the correlations
between features
