Anchors

Usage
-----

Anchors are an approach that trains an explainer on your dataset, which then can be given an instance to interpret. The interpretation 
you are given is a series of if-then statements that describe the conditions for the prediction. In contrast to other explainability methods that take
individual instances for explanations - anchors have the capability to predict globally on unseen data.

For example in the Iris dataset, when the anchor algorithms encounters the following instance:

.. code-block::

       sepal length (cm)  sepal width (cm)  petal length (cm)  petal width (cm)
    0                6.3               3.3                6.0               2.5


It outputs the following explanation:

.. code-block::

    IF      petal length (cm) > 5.23
    AND     sepal length (cm) > 5.80
    THEN PREDICT Class 3 WITH 100.0% CONFIDENCE.


To run the function it requires only one instance to be passed, with the categorical features if necessary.

.. code-block::

    xai.anchor.anchor_explanation(test_x[42], categorical_names={2:["Male","Female"]})


The key of the categorical_names parameter is the index of the feature, with the value being a list of all the possible values it can take.

Caveats
-------

You will find that in regression problems, the explainer will often spit out explanations for which it is 0% confident. This is due to the continuous nature of regression, however
this can be worked around by first transforming the targets into classes before training your model. Increasing the number of you classes you choose here will give you a greater 
prediction accuracy but will inevitably give you a less useful Anchor explanation, either because the confidence rating will drop, or more conditions will be used.

Also don't call this function more than once unless you **really** like ValueErrors.
