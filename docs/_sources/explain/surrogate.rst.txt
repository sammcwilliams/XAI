Usage
-----

Tree-like models have a lot more transparency in terms of interpretability, and as such this module's purpose is to approximate the function of the given model
and remodel it into tree form. The resulting image is the surrogate model in tree form, with the decision rules on each node.

.. code-block::

    xai.surrogate.global_surrogate(filename="tree_surrogate.png")
    
For the Iris dataset, the Random Forest Classifier defined in the Initialisation section is reinterpreted as the following decision tree. While I do understand that 
reinterpreting a tree as another surrogate tree is pointless, this works for all sklearn models so the princible is there.
